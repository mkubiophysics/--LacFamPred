INTRODUCTION
------------

β-lacFamPred, predict the family of betalactamase into proteins/genes sequences with complete annotation. This method was based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) which is a probalistic method it includes evolutionary information (MSA) of each family also it facilitated with detailed annotation.

Here we describe a novel Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based tool, β-lacFamPred, to predict β-lactamase familes using protein/gene sequences. The β-lacFamPred standalone software and web-server are freely available for academic use under GNU GPL.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

The β-lacFamPred tool has been tested on Linux/Unix and Mac systems. It requires HMMER for searching sequence using profile databases for sequence homologs.


INSTALLATION
------------
1. unpack "blacfampred_standalone.tar.gz"
   tar -xvzf blacfampred_standalone.tar.gz
   cd blacfampred_standalone/
2. Install the HMMER v3.1 package to run HMMSCAN & NHMMSCAN from the blacfampred_standalone folder.
step1: uncompress:   	  	  uncompress hmmer-3.1b2.tar.gz  
step2: unpack: 	   	    	  tar -xvzf hmmer-3.1b2.tar
step3: move into new directory:	  cd hmmer-3.1b2
step4: configure:    		  ./configure
step5: build:			  make
step6: automated tests:        	  make check
step7: automated install:         make install

3. Define the complete path of installed HMMER for 'HMMSCAN for protein sequences' and 'NHMMSCAN for nucleotide sequences' for scanning of AR genes. 

USAGE
-----
1. Input file should be in fasta format.

2. Please use below command for scanning of protein/Gene/small reads library(Before using this command please specify the Path of HMMER, fasta sequence file & profile ARG HMMs like nARGhmm or pARGhmm) 
a. Users can select the number of CPUs accordingly depending on the processor capability(By default 1)
b. Users can change the E-value threshold accordingly [default=10.0]  (x>0)
c. Users can change the output format accordingly

3. Please provide the path of compressed ARG HMM profiles (pARGHMM & nARGHMM)for scanning of AR genes provided in blacfampred_standalone directory.

command for protein sequence scanning:== “/hmmer-3.1b2-linux-intel-x86_64/src/hmmscan --cpu 4 -E 0.000001 --tblout xyz.out pARGhmm/TOTAL_96_families.hmm xxx_protein.fasta”

command for nucleotide sequences/small read library scanning:== "/hmmer-3.1b2-linux-intel-x86_64/src/nhmmscan --cpu 4 -E 0.000001 --tblout xyz.out nARGhmm/Total_96_families_nucleotide.hmm gene.fasta"

4. Result will be saved in the given output file like here "xyz.out". The User can also check the e-value and similarity score in output file on the basis of that you can select the best hit against your query protein.

5. User can annotate the corresponding HMM found against search using annotation file (96_annotations.txt). 

 =================*****************************************************************===========

User can use run programs (run_protein.pl/run_nucleotide.pl) directly for scanning their gene/protein (example_protein_seqs.fasta/example_gene_seqs.fasta) sequences.
